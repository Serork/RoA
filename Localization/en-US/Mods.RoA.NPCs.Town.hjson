	Quote1: There, behind you! Ah, that must have been the wind.
	Quote2: An awfully unpleasant druid has told me this part of the forest is off limits. I think I am starting to understand why.
	Quote3: I don’t quite remember the road I took to get here. I had to cut through some foliage, but now it seems to have grown back right behind me.
	Quote4: I used to be unafraid of any monster, but in this place they are most horrifying. You see them too, don’t you kid?
	Quote5: Be careful, there is a giant beast following in my footsteps… I must be ready for an attack any moment now.
	Quote6: I had to make a run for it, so my clothes need mending. I’m willing to spare some coin for any leather you have in your possession.
	Quote7: Argh!!! Startle me like that again and I’ll start blasting!
	Quote8: Harpoon? Sorry, kid, but this gun shoots real bullets.
	Quote9: Me, afraid of the dark? You must be kidding me! The dark should be afraid of me.
	Quote10: I could use some leather but my hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. If you can procure some, I am willing to trade.
	Quote11: Last night, I almost shot a tree! I swear, it looked like it was smiling at me wisely.
	Quote12: Any creature who dares to ambush should know that I can… I will defend myself!
	Quote13: I’ve seen a dozen lumberjacks walking about, but they haven’t cut a single tree! So, what I'm wondering is - who’s paying them?!
	Quote14: Hey, at least I didn’t get lost in a poisonous swamp. Trust me, those places are inhabited by dark souls.
	Quote15: A “wild” hunt? That just sounds like a regular hunt to me, kid.
	Quote16: Every time I turn, I leave a mark on a tree. Yet somehow, I always end up back in the same spot! What kind of a world is this?
	Quote17: These woods… I can feel the weight of their history upon my mind. It is dangerous to stay here.
	NotEnoughTradeQuote1: I am interested in refined leather only! If I had a use for dirty scraps, I would have already skinned the carcasses of my prey.
	NotEnoughTradeQuote2: Are you trying to swindle me? If you don’t have any leather you better get out of my way!
	NotEnoughTradeQuote3: The last thing you want to do is taunt a desperate man like me, kid.
	TradeQuote1: Thank you. With this leather, I may live to fight another day.
	TradeQuote2: Much obliged. These supplies will serve me well.
	TradeQuote3: Thank you, kid. Now I am sure I won't be dead by daylight.
	TradeQuote4: Splendid! For once, I am not left for dead.
	DropFireLighterQuote1: Listen, kid. I have a feeling we're not going to meet again. Please take this... I no longer have a use for it.

Dryad: {
	IntroQuote: At last, I am free from this cocoon, thanks to you. Growing in silence for centuries has been excruciating.
	AwakeQuote1: The other Dryads… tell me, have they survived? No, I can already sense it isn’t so.
	AwakeQuote2: Is the war of Cthulhu over? If so, why is his presence still plaguing this world?
	AwakeQuote3: A drastic change in the world has spurred my awakening. A powerful monster was slain... was that your doing?
	AwakeQuote4: I know this is a great burden for us to bear, but this world's balance need to be restored.
	AwakeQuote5: I would welcome a better place to put down roots. Not in a literal sense, of course!

GoblinTinkerer.PettyGoblinQuote1: Did you get ransacked by that sleazy fool with a magic sack? Tell you what, you're not alone.

Guide: {
	HelpText1: Have you seen that wooden cocoon? It has stayed dormant for ages. Maybe defeating a powerful foe will bring it to life?
	HelpText2: Have you checked on that wooden woman? Perhaps she needs a little push...
	HelpText3: Once you forge appropriate tools, nothing should stop you from chopping down those trees in the backwoods.
	HelpText4: Have you seen those chests hidden deep below in the backwoods? A strong pickaxe may help you reach them.
	HelpText5: That altar in the backwoods yearns for souls of those who once worshipped it. Try fulfilling its hunger if you seek an ancient monster.
