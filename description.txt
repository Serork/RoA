From the creators of Consolaria, presenting 'Rise of Ages'!

--------------

!Attention! 
This mod is in its 'Early Access' state. Do not expect to be overwhelmed by content.
Well, to be fair, neither the full release is planned to be overflowing with content. Just a nice, condensed experience.

--------------

Release 1.0.0 of this mod adds:

- A new Biome - 'The Backwoods'
A gloomy forest with its land shaded by the tall and dense canopy. A home to feral wildlife and those who delve into the world of magic far much more 'primal'.

- A new Class - 'The Druid'
Step onto a new path, attunning with the primordial nature through the means of Wreaths, transform into wild creatures and fight, becoming stronger, the longer the quarrel goes on.

- A new Boss - 'Lothor the Wild'
It was difficult to put the soul together, but unfortunately, something went so wrong. And now this creature can't do anything, but hunt those who go too far.

- And a handful of other things to spice up the gameplay.
