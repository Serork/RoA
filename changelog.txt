- Tanning Rack has been reworked:
-- Raw leather no longer expires when the buff runs out; each item has its own timer with an indicator
-- Raw leather no longer stacks and drops less often, but gives a larger quantity of refined leather when processed
-- Modded sources of refined leather now provide raw leather with the usual expiration time, regardless of the buff
-- The buff can no longer be cancelled and the rack cannot be placed while under its effect to prevent exploits
-- Localization and sounds have been updated
- Fixed the game crashing upon opening the mod configuration while Starlight River is enabled
- The Show/Hide Wreath Slot text is now localized and consistent with vanilla
- Bloodshed Axe and Fleder Slayer no longer break the character's shoulder animation
- Improved Sacrificial Sickle's Moon Sigil projectile visuals
- Druid Soul now plays its death sound slightly earlier
- Tulip weapons now create particles less often
- Added a few more custom colours for Moon Flower for friends and contributors
