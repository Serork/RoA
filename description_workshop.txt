[h1]Info[/h1]

[b]RoA[/b] is focused on adding highly polished content that seamlessly expands Terraria‚Äôs features, from exploration to combat. 
The mod features unique mechanics and an immersive story which can be discovered organically through world structures, NPC dialogue and bestiary entries.
Developed by the team behind [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2864843929]Consolaria[/url], Rise of Ages is designed to provide a nice, condensed experience rather than an overwhelming amount of surface-level content.

This "early access" version features a new Druid class and Backwoods biome with complete Pre-Hardmode progression, as well as a variety of miscellaneous content to spice up your playthrough, regardless of the class of your choice. 

[h1]List of content[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Backwoods.[/b] An ancient forest once inhabited by Dryads has fallen under a dark influence and holds many dangers for an unsuspecting adventurer, but its true power has been suppressed by the world evil...  
[*] [b]Druid.[/b] Attuning to primordial nature through hand-made Wreaths and controlling the environment, druids become stronger the longer the fight goes on, covering the battlefield in canopy and taking shape of wild beasts.
[*] [b]Fog.[/b] An eerie weather event that may occur after the rain covers the backwoods and its surrounding area in a thick layer of mist, reducing visibility and allowing enemies to catch you off-guard.
[*] [b]Lothor.[/b] A late Pre-Hardmode boss - the mightiest druid from an age long past, whose quest for immortality has gone very wrong.
[*] [b]Materials.[/b] Mercurium, Galipot and Leather can be obtained through unique and challenging mechanics, and provide a variety of new equipment options. 
[*] [b]Alchemy.[/b] The mod adds two new herbs and plenty of potions, as well as reworking most of the vanilla recipes. 
[/list]
[b]And much more![/b]

Includes support for [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2669644269]Boss Checklist[/url][/b], [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927542027]Achievement Mod[/url][/b] and [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985966860]Music Display[/url][/b].

[h1]F.A.Q.[/h1]

[b]What are the plans for future updates?[/b]
Our priority is to extend the Druid and Backwoods content into Hardmode to make the mod available for a complete playthrough. After that? Perhaps an expansion of the Underground Backwoods, and a deeper dive into the story that we are developing...

[b]Is the mod compatible with ___ ?[/b]
Rise of Ages has been tested with most major mods, and does not cause any game-breaking issues. But beware of balancing mismatches - our content is designed around vanilla Terraria.

[b]How do I get ___ or summon ___ ?[/b]
Ask the Guide, use Recipe Browser or Boss Checklist. A wiki is coming soon. You can also ask for specific guidance in #roa-help.

[b]Do I need to create a new world?[/b]
Yes, otherwise you will be locked out of a major portion of the content. Small worlds work fine, but we recommend Medium and above.

[b]Does the mod work in multiplayer?[/b]
Yes!

[b]After many years in the oven, we hope you enjoy![/b]
